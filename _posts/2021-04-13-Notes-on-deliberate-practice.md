# Deliberate Practice

- Practice means *Preparing* 
- *Deliberate Practice* intends to perform some activity with an objective to improve some associated skill. We rehearse what to do in low pressure situations so that we are able to produce the same skills when the pressure is high or something bigger is at stake
- Deliberate means to go with an agenda, to work on a specific task, to focus on one point and to make it better

```
Geoff Colvin summarizes deliberate practice as such in Talent Is Overrated:

Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth examining. It is activity designed specifically to improve performance, often with a teacher’s help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results is continuously available; it’s highly demanding mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn’t much fun.
    
```

**Deliberate Practice: Characteristics**

- Aims at constant practice
- Having matrices for measuring performance
- Focus to improve defined matrices
- Finding out the gaps in performance
- Improving the gaps in performance

**Deliberate Practice: First Steps**

- Identify objective standards of performance
- Study top performers
- Design practice activities reflecting what do you intend to achieve

**Deliberate Practice: Implementation**

- Take any skill and break it into smallest possible parts
- Plan building through them logically (Start with fundamentals)
- Create a practice calendar to avoid aimless time wasting
- Don't get disheartened is success is not in sight
- Plan can be changed as new limitations are discovered
- It is not supposed to be fun. Keep at it
- Challenge the comfort zone (Key to check this: If you ever feel bored or zoned out during practice, it is not deliberate practice!!)
- Plan for 10% increased difficulty (Break sessions into sprints)
- Think long term (1 hour per day is sufficient if done for a long time)
- Develop intrinsic status (Practice for its own sake)
- Use spaced repetition to make the stuff stick
