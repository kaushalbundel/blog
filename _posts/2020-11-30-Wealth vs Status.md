# Understanding Wealth Mindset and its difference with Status Mindset

I had seen the terms "Wealth" and "Status" on an episode of **BeerBiceps Podcast** by Ranveer Allahbadia with Kunal Shah of cred frame.

[Youtube link of the Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH6WUTFmgg8&t=3612s)

The topic was quite interesting with Kunal Shah explaining that there are two kinds of societies, wealth driven and status driven and there is a lot of difference between these two types of socities. The topic was covered very briefly and more context was derived by reading Kunal's Twitter timeline.

## How I see status and wealth driven mindset 

The points that are specified for society can be similarly applied for mindset as well. A person who is living in a status driven society is more susceptable to be inflicted with status driven mindset and vice versa. What's important here is to evaluate ones actions in terms of "status driven" or "wealth driven". The final objective of the evaluation is to think in such as way as to habituate the wealth driven actions and deloop status driven actions from day to day routine.
